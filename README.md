# ToDo-List-Project

This an To Do list app meant to develop my javascrip skills, and will be mostly built using the DOM to explore more its potential. The structure will contain a head with an usuer input, submit button and clear list, and a body with the created items as a list with two options (buttons) to individually mark as done and delete it.

App breakdown:

HEAD:
- TITLE
- USER INPUT
- SUBMIT INPUT
- CLEAR LIST

BODY:

- INPUT ORDERED LIST
	- ITEM
		- DELETE BUTTON
		- DONE BUTTON

~~This readme file will be updated as the project develops~~

This projected is completed
